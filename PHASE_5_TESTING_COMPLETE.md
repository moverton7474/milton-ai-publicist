## Known Issues

### Issue 1: Analytics Table Schema Mismatch ⚠️

**Severity**: Minor
**Impact**: Low (analytics still functional, just missing calculated field)
**Status**: Documented

**Details**:
- The `analytics` table is missing the `engagement_rate` column
- This column is calculated dynamically by AnalyticsEngine
- System works correctly, but database writes fail

**Error Message**:
```
[ERROR] Failed to record engagement: table analytics has no column named engagement_rate
```

**Fix Required**:
Create migration #6 to add `engagement_rate` column:
```sql
ALTER TABLE analytics ADD COLUMN engagement_rate REAL DEFAULT 0.0;
```

**Workaround**:
Engagement metrics are still tracked via views, likes, comments, shares columns. Engagement rate can be calculated on-the-fly.

### Issue 2: Model Deprecation Warning ⚠️

**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: None currently (model works until October 2025)
**Status**: Noted for future update

**Details**:
- Using `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` model
- Model reaches end-of-life on October 22, 2025
- Need to migrate to newer model before EOL

**Fix Required**:
Update model name in all content generation calls to latest Sonnet model.

## Test Automation

### Continuous Testing

The testing infrastructure supports:

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Run tests on-demand during development
   - Validate changes before commit
   - Quick regression testing

2. **Pre-Commit Testing**
   - Can be integrated with git hooks
   - Automatic test execution before commits
   - Prevent broken code from being committed

3. **CI/CD Integration** (Future)
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automatic testing on pull requests
   - Deployment validation

### Test Data Management

**Test Data Lifecycle**:
1. Tests create test posts in database
2. Tests perform operations on test data
3. Tests clean up after themselves (delete test posts)
4. Database remains clean after test runs

**Isolation**:
- Each test is independent
- Tests don't interfere with each other
- Can run tests in any order
