ZAPIER PUBLISH BLOCKER - THE FIX
================================================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-------------------
Your "Data out" tab shows:
  Url: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7480282464972869665/

This LinkedIn URL shouldn't be there! It's from a previous test and is now
blocking publication.


THE FIX (3 SIMPLE STEPS):
--------------------------

STEP 1: Click "Configure" tab
        (at the top of your LinkedIn action)

STEP 2: Find "Content - URL" field
        - This field likely has that LinkedIn URL in it
        - Click the X button on the right side of the field
        - OR press Ctrl+A then Delete
        - Field should be completely EMPTY

STEP 3: Verify ALL optional fields are EMPTY
        - Content - Title: EMPTY
        - Content - Description: EMPTY
        - Content - Image URL: EMPTY
        - Content - URL: EMPTY


YOUR CORRECT CONFIGURATION:
---------------------------

LinkedIn - Create Share Update

Account: [Your LinkedIn Profile Name]
Comment: 1__content                    <-- ONLY required field with data
Content - Title: [EMPTY]               <-- Must be empty
Content - Description: [EMPTY]         <-- Must be empty
Content - Image URL: [EMPTY]           <-- Must be empty
Content - URL: [EMPTY]                 <-- THIS ONE likely has the LinkedIn URL!
Visible To: anyone


AFTER YOU CLEAR THOSE FIELDS:
------------------------------
1. Click "Continue" button at bottom
2. Click "Skip test" (don't test again)
3. Click "Publish" button (top-right)
4. Turn Zap ON


ALTERNATIVE: START FRESH
-------------------------
If clearing fields doesn't work:

1. Delete Step 2 (LinkedIn action) - click trash icon
2. Click "Add step"
3. Choose "LinkedIn" -> "Create Share Update"
4. Connect account
5. Fill ONLY Comment field with: 1__content
6. Fill Visible To with: anyone
7. Leave ALL other fields blank
8. Skip test
9. Publish


WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING:
--------------------------
Zapier's test feature saves output from previous tests (like the LinkedIn
post URL) and tries to reuse it. When you configure optional fields, Zapier
auto-fills them with this old test data, causing conflicts.

SOLUTION: Don't fill optional fields unless you're actually sending that data
from your backend.


WHAT YOUR BACKEND SENDS:
-------------------------
{
  "content": "Post text here",
  "platform": "linkedin",
  "post_id": 123,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T09:00:00Z"
}

Only "content" is mapped (to 1__content in Comment field).
Everything else (title, description, images, URLs) is NOT sent.
Therefore, those fields should be EMPTY in Zapier.


BOTTOM LINE:
------------
The "Content - URL" field has a LinkedIn URL in it from a previous test.
Clear it. Leave it empty. Then publish.
