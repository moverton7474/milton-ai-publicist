QUICK FIX FOR YOUR ZAPIER LINKEDIN ISSUE
================================================================================

THE PROBLEM:
-----------
Your optional fields have webhook URLs in them. This is WRONG.

FIELDS WITH ERRORS:
  Content - Description: https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/25056295/u-r1ik42/
  Content - Image URL: https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/25056295/u-r1ik42/
  Content - URL: https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/25056295/u-r1ik42/

THE FIX (3 STEPS):
------------------

STEP 1: Click "Configure" tab (at the top of LinkedIn action)

STEP 2: Find these 3 fields and DELETE the webhook URLs:

  Field: Content - Description
  Action: Click in field, press Ctrl+A, press Delete
  Result: Field should be EMPTY

  Field: Content - Image URL
  Action: Click in field, press Ctrl+A, press Delete
  Result: Field should be EMPTY

  Field: Content - URL
  Action: Click in field, press Ctrl+A, press Delete
  Result: Field should be EMPTY

STEP 3: Click "Continue" button at bottom

THEN: Click "Publish" in top-right corner


YOUR CORRECT CONFIGURATION SHOULD BE:
-------------------------------------

LinkedIn Action - "Create Share Update"

  Account: [Your LinkedIn Name]

  Comment: 1__content  <-- THIS IS THE ONLY REQUIRED FIELD

  Content - Title: [EMPTY] <-- Leave blank
  Content - Description: [EMPTY] <-- Leave blank
  Content - Image URL: [EMPTY] <-- Leave blank
  Content - URL: [EMPTY] <-- Leave blank

  Visible To: Anyone


WHY THIS HAPPENED:
------------------
When you clicked those optional fields, Zapier auto-suggested the webhook URL
from Step 1. But those fields should either be EMPTY or map to webhook DATA
(like 1__title, 1__description), NOT the webhook URL itself.

The webhook URL only belongs in Step 1 (Catch Hook).


AFTER YOU FIX IT:
-----------------
1. Delete the webhook URLs from those 3 fields
2. Leave them blank
3. Click Continue
4. Click Publish
5. Turn Zap ON
6. Test from your dashboard


TEST COMMAND:
-------------
cd "c:\Users\mover\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\All State RevShield Engine AJ\milton-publicist"
python test_publish_to_linkedin.py


================================================================================
BOTTOM LINE: Delete those webhook URLs from the optional fields!
