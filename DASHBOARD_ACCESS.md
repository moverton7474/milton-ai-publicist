## What Requires LinkedIn OAuth Setup

‚è≥ **Publish to LinkedIn** button (needs 15-20 min OAuth setup)

**To enable publishing**: See [CLERK_SETUP_NEXT_STEPS.md](CLERK_SETUP_NEXT_STEPS.md)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard won't load at localhost:8081

**Check if server is running**:
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :8081
```

**Restart the server**:
1. Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the dashboard
2. Run `python run_dashboard_8081.py` again

### Generated content seems generic

**Check**:
- Correct voice type selected (Personal vs. Professional)
- Specific context provided
- Look for signature phrase "Let's Go Owls!"
- Word count matches (20-80 or 200-400)

### Can't click "Publish to LinkedIn"

**This is expected!** Publishing requires OAuth setup first.
**See**: [CLERK_SETUP_NEXT_STEPS.md](CLERK_SETUP_NEXT_STEPS.md)

Make sure you're accessing the correct one!

## Next Steps

2. ‚úÖ **Generate test content** - Try both voice types
3. ‚è≥ **Complete LinkedIn OAuth** - Enable publishing (15-20 min)
4. ‚è≥ **Publish first post** - One-click to LinkedIn!
