# Zapier Not Receiving Webhooks - Diagnosis

## The Problem

Your Zapier Task History shows: **"No results found"**

This means **the webhook never reached Zapier**.

Your dashboard sent it successfully (HTTP 200), but Zapier didn't receive it.

---

## Your Current Configuration

**Webhook URL in .env file:**
```
ZAPIER_LINKEDIN_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/25056295/ur1ik42/
```

**Dashboard:** Running on port 8080
**Test Result:** HTTP 200 OK (dashboard thinks it worked)
**Zapier Task History:** No tasks found (webhook never arrived)

## Most Likely Cause: Zap is Turned OFF

When you published your Zap, you might have forgotten to turn it ON, or it automatically turned OFF.

### How to Check:

1. Go to: https://zapier.com/app/zaps
2. Find your Zap (might be called "Untitled Zap")
3. Look at the toggle switch next to it:
   - **Blue/Green = ON** ✅
   - **Gray = OFF** ❌

### If it's OFF:

1. Click the gray toggle to turn it ON
2. It should turn blue/green
3. Wait 5-10 seconds
4. Test again:
   ```powershell
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/publish/test/linkedin"
   ```
5. Check Zapier history again: https://zapier.com/app/history

## Other Possible Causes

### Cause 2: Webhook URL Changed

When you were editing your Zap configuration (fixing those optional fields), the webhook URL might have changed.

### How to Check:

1. Go to: https://zapier.com/app/zaps
2. Find your Zap
3. Click "Edit"
4. Click on **Step 1** (Catch Hook)
5. Look for the webhook URL displayed
6. **Copy it**
7. Compare it to your .env file: `https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/25056295/ur1ik42/`

**If they don't match:**

1. Update your .env file with the correct URL
2. Restart your dashboard
3. Test again

---

### Cause 3: Zapier Free Tier Limit Reached

Zapier free tier allows 750 tasks per month.

### How to Check:

1. Go to: https://zapier.com/app/zaps
2. Look at the top of the page
3. You should see: "X / 750 tasks used this month"

**If you're at 750/750:**

Your Zap won't receive new webhooks until next month, or you need to upgrade.

**If you're under 750:**

This isn't the issue.

### Cause 4: Zapier Webhook Expired

Sometimes Zapier webhook URLs expire if not used for a long time, or if the Zap was deleted and recreated.

### How to Fix:

1. Delete the current Zap entirely
2. Create a brand new Zap from scratch:
   - Trigger: Webhooks by Zapier → Catch Hook
   - Copy the NEW webhook URL
   - Action: LinkedIn → Create Share Update
   - Connect your LinkedIn account
   - Map Comment field to `1__content`
   - Leave all other fields blank
   - Publish and turn ON
3. Update your .env file with the NEW webhook URL
4. Restart dashboard
5. Test again

## Step-by-Step Fix (Most Common Issue)

### Step 1: Turn Your Zap ON

1. Go to: https://zapier.com/app/zaps
2. Find your Zap
3. If the toggle is gray (OFF), click it to turn it ON
4. Wait 10 seconds

### Step 2: Verify Webhook URL

1. In your Zap, click "Edit"
2. Click on Step 1 (Catch Hook)
3. Copy the webhook URL
4. Compare it to line 124 in your .env file
5. If different, update .env file
6. Restart dashboard if you changed the URL

### Step 3: Test Again

Run:
```powershell
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/publish/test/linkedin"
```

Wait 10-15 seconds, then check:
- Zapier history: https://zapier.com/app/history
- You should see a new task appear!

### Step 4: If Task Appears

1. Click on the task
2. Check if it's green (success) or red (error)
3. If green, check LinkedIn for your post
4. If red, read the error and fix it

## Quick Visual Check

Take a screenshot showing:

1. **Your Zaps page** (https://zapier.com/app/zaps)
   - Show your Zap name
   - Show the toggle switch (ON or OFF)
   - Show task usage (X / 750)

2. **Step 1 Configuration** (if URL might have changed)
   - Edit your Zap
   - Click Step 1 (Catch Hook)
   - Show the webhook URL

This will help diagnose the exact issue!

## After You Turn It ON

Once your Zap is ON, test immediately:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\mover\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\All State RevShield Engine AJ\milton-publicist"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/publish/test/linkedin"
```

Then refresh Zapier history: https://zapier.com/app/history

You should see a new task appear within 10-15 seconds!

## Bottom Line

**99% certain the Zap is turned OFF.**

Go to https://zapier.com/app/zaps and check the toggle switch!
