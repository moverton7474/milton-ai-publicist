## Costs

**DALL-E 3 Graphics**:
- Standard Quality (1024x1024): $0.02 per image
- HD Quality (1792x1024): $0.04 per image ← Default

**Monthly Examples**:
- 25 posts with graphics = $1.00/month
- 50 posts with graphics = $2.00/month
- 100 posts with graphics = $4.00/month
- 250 posts with graphics = $10.00/month

**Very affordable for professional-quality content!**

---

## Placeholder Logos

Placeholder logos have been created in `assets/logos/`:

- `ksu_logo.png` - Gold rectangle with "KSU" text (works fine for testing)
- `vystar_logo.png` - Gold rectangle with "VyStar" text
- `gamechanger_logo.png` - Gold rectangle with "GameChanger" text

**These work fine for testing!**

**When you have real logos**:
1. Get PNG files with transparent backgrounds (RGBA format)
2. Recommended size: 400x200 pixels or similar
3. Name them exactly: `ksu_logo.png`, `vystar_logo.png`, `gamechanger_logo.png`
4. Replace files in `assets/logos/`
5. System will automatically use your real logos (no code changes needed)

---

## Optional: Avatar Videos

**Not Required** - Graphics alone are very powerful!

If you want Milton speaking on video later:

**Setup** (10 minutes + $24/month):
1. Sign up at https://www.heygen.com
2. Get API key from dashboard
3. Add to `.env`: `HEYGEN_API_KEY=your_key_here`
4. Create custom Milton avatar (upload photo)
5. Clone Milton's voice (upload audio sample)
6. Set avatar ID and voice ID in `.env`

**Then in dashboard**:
- Check ✓ "Generate Avatar Video"
- Wait 1-3 minutes for rendering
- Get photorealistic video of Milton speaking the announcement

**Cost**: $24/month for 15 minutes of video = $1.60 per minute

**Current Status**: Not set up (graphics are enough for now!)
