## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. Voice Profile Modeling ([voice_modeling.py](module_ii/voice_modeling.py))

**Purpose:** Train NLP models on Milton's existing content to create authentic voice profile

**Features:**
- ✅ Lexical analysis (vocabulary, word frequency, terminology)
- ✅ Syntactic analysis (sentence structure, complexity)
- ✅ Semantic analysis (themes, entities, topics)
- ✅ Rhetorical device detection (questions, metaphors, data usage)
- ✅ Formatting preferences (bullets, line breaks, emojis)
- ✅ Tone analysis (optimistic, analytical, personal)
- ✅ spaCy integration (optional, falls back to regex)
- ✅ Database storage of trained profiles

**Usage:**
```bash
# Train voice profile from Milton's content
python module_ii/voice_modeling.py --corpus-dir data/milton_content/ --version 2.0.0
```

**Input:** Directory of Milton's LinkedIn posts, articles, speeches (txt files)

**Output:** Comprehensive voice profile stored in `voice_profile` table:
- Avg sentence length: ~18 words
- Question ratio: ~15%
- Storytelling ratio: ~20%
- Primary tone: visionary_strategic_approachable
- Vocabulary size, common phrases, domain terminology

---

### 2. Content Generator ([content_generator.py](module_ii/content_generator.py))

**Purpose:** Generate voice-authentic content across multiple platforms

**Platforms Supported:**
1. **LinkedIn Posts** (primary)
   - 300-500 words
   - Hook in first 2 lines
   - Strategic line breaks
   - 3-5 hashtags
   - Engaging CTA question

2. **Twitter/X Threads**
   - 3-5 tweets per thread
   - Each <280 characters
   - Standalone first tweet hook
   - Punchy, conversational tone

3. **Avatar Video Scripts**
   - 30-90 second scripts
   - Speaking-appropriate pacing (2.5 words/sec)
   - [PAUSE] markers and emphasis
   - HeyGen/Synthesia ready

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Claude API integration for generation
- ✅ Voice profile application (matches Milton's style)
- ✅ Platform-specific formatting
- ✅ Optimal posting time calculation
- ✅ Hashtag extraction
- ✅ @mention suggestions
- ✅ Visual content suggestions
- ✅ Database storage of generated content

**API Methods:**
```python
# Generate LinkedIn post
await generator.generate_linkedin_post(
    opportunity_id=1,
    target_pillar="AI Innovation in Sports Business",
    include_personal_story=True
)

# Generate Twitter thread
await generator.generate_twitter_thread(
    opportunity_id=1,
    linkedin_content=linkedin_post  # Optional: adapt from LinkedIn
)

# Generate avatar video script
await generator.generate_avatar_script(
    purpose="KSU Donor Fund promotion",
    key_message="AI-driven donor engagement",
    duration_seconds=60,
    style="professional"
)
```

**Content Quality:**
- Matches Milton's avg sentence length (~18 words)
- Maintains his question ratio (~15%)
- Balances strategic insights (80%) with personal stories (20%)
- Avoids generic "AI speak"
- Positions as AI innovator in college sports

---

### 3. Quality Assurance System ([quality_assurance.py](module_ii/quality_assurance.py))

**Purpose:** Automated QA checks before content goes to approval queue

**6 Quality Checks:**

1. **Voice Authenticity** (75% threshold)
   - Uses Claude to compare against voice profile
   - Checks tone, structure, vocabulary
   - Detects generic corporate speak
   - Verifies authentic feel

2. **Brand Alignment** (80% threshold)
   - Maps to 3 thought leadership pillars:
     - AI Innovation in Sports Business
     - Leadership & Vision
     - Future of College Sports
   - Checks for KSU Donor Fund mentions
   - Avoids over-promotional tone

3. **Platform Compliance** (85% threshold)
   - **LinkedIn:** Length (300-500 words), hook structure, hashtags (3-5), CTA question
   - **Twitter:** Thread length (3-5 tweets), character limits (<280), hook quality

4. **Engagement Potential** (60% threshold)
   - Question inclusion (drives comments)
   - Hook strength
   - Data/statistics inclusion
   - Personal story elements
   - Optimal length

5. **Readability** (70% threshold)
   - Sentence length analysis
   - Grade level appropriateness
   - Professional yet accessible

6. **Overall Score** (75% threshold)
   - Weighted average of all checks
   - Pass/fail determination
   - Ready for approval flag

**Usage:**
```python
qa = QualityAssurance(anthropic_api_key, db_url)
await qa.initialize()

# Run full QA check
result = await qa.full_qa_check(content_id=1)

# Result includes:
{
    "overall_score": 0.82,
    "passed": True,
    "ready_for_approval": True,
    "checks": { ... },
    "recommendations": [...]
}
```

**Database Integration:**
- Updates `generated_content` table with QA scores
- Sets status to `pending_approval` if passed
- Stores individual check scores for analytics

## 🎓 Example Output

### LinkedIn Post Generated:
```
The future of college athletics isn't just about adapting to technology—
it's about leading with it.

While most athletic departments are still figuring out NIL compliance,
forward-thinking programs are already using AI to transform how they
engage donors, manage relationships, and drive revenue.

At Keuka College, we took a different approach. Instead of waiting for
the "perfect" solution, we built the KSU Donor Fund AI system—a practical
implementation that's already showing results. Our AI-powered outreach
doesn't replace the human touch; it amplifies it.

Here's what we're seeing:
• 40% increase in donor engagement
• Personalized outreach at scale
• Data-driven insights that actually drive decisions

The lesson? Innovation in college sports isn't about having the biggest
budget. It's about being willing to experiment, iterate, and lead.

What's one area in your athletic department where AI could make an
immediate impact?

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Voice profile has low accuracy:**
- Solution: Add more training data (recommend 50+ posts)
- Check corpus quality (ensure authentic Milton content)

**Generated content doesn't match voice:**
- Check voice_profile table for active profile
- Retrain with more representative samples
- Adjust QA thresholds if too strict

**QA always fails:**
- Review threshold settings in .env
- Check individual score breakdowns
- May need to adjust thresholds for your use case

**Claude API errors:**
- Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is valid
- Check API rate limits
- Ensure sufficient credits
