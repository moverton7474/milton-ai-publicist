- **Coaches**: 20,000+ (head coaches at all levels)
- **Sports Executives**: 10,000+ (conference offices, leagues, agencies)

### Competitive Landscape
- **Hootsuite**: $99-739/month (complex, not AI-powered)
- **Buffer**: $6-120/month (basic scheduling, no content generation)
- **Later**: $18-80/month (Instagram-focused, no AI)
- **Opportunity**: No competitor offers AI-powered, voice-authentic content generation for sports executives

### Pricing Strategy
- **Individual**: $149/month (Milton's current use case)
- **Team**: $499/month (5 users, approval workflows)
- **Enterprise**: $1,999/month (unlimited users, premium support)

### Revenue Projections

**Conservative Model** ($149/month individual):
```
Month 6:   50 users √ó $149 = $7,450/month ($89K ARR)
Month 12: 100 users √ó $149 = $14,900/month ($179K ARR)
Year 2:   250 users √ó $149 = $37,250/month ($447K ARR)
```

**Aggressive Model** (mix of individual/team/enterprise):
```
Month 12: 80 individual + 15 teams + 3 enterprise
          = $11,920 + $7,485 + $5,997
          = $25,402/month ($305K ARR)

Year 2:   200 individual + 40 teams + 10 enterprise
          = $29,800 + $19,960 + $19,990
          = $69,750/month ($837K ARR)

Year 3:   400 individual + 80 teams + 25 enterprise
          = $59,600 + $39,920 + $49,975
          = $149,495/month ($1.79M ARR)
