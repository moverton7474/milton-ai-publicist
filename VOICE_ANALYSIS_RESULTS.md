## Comparison: Before vs. After Voice Training

### BEFORE Voice Training (Generic AI-Generated)

**Word Count:** 286 words
**Style:** Long-form thought leadership essay
**Topics:** AI strategy, donor analytics, data-driven insights
**Tone:** Corporate, strategic, analytical

While billion-dollar programs invest in AI for recruiting, they're missing the biggest opportunity. Traditional donor engagement in college athletics follows a predictable pattern..."

**Why This FAILS:**
- ❌ Way too long (286 words vs. Milton's typical 20-80)
- ❌ Corporate thought leadership style
- ❌ Self-promotional (Milton focuses on others)
- ❌ Data-heavy business analysis (not Milton's style)
- ❌ Missing "Let's Go Owls!" signature
- ❌ No personal warmth or gratitude
