---

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Engagement Tracking

Record detailed metrics for each post:
```python
POST /api/analytics/engagement
{
  "post_id": 1,
  "platform": "linkedin",
  "views": 250,
  "likes": 18,
  "comments": 5,
  "shares": 3,
  "clicks": 12
}
```

**Automatic Calculations:**
- Engagement rate: `(likes + comments + shares + clicks) / views * 100`
- Stores all metrics in `analytics` table

### 2. Best Time to Post

**Analyzes historical data to find:**
- Best day of week (e.g., "Tuesday - 7.2% avg engagement")
- Best hour of day (e.g., "10:00 - 8.5% avg engagement")
- Top 3 day/hour combinations (e.g., "Tuesday at 10:00 - 9.1%")

**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "platform": "linkedin",
  "data_points": 25,
  "best_day": {
    "day": "Tuesday",
    "avg_engagement": 7.2
  },
  "best_hour": {
    "hour": 10,
    "avg_engagement": 8.5
  },
  "top_combinations": [
    {"time": "Tuesday at 10:00", "avg_engagement": 9.1},
    {"time": "Thursday at 14:00", "avg_engagement": 8.3},
    {"time": "Wednesday at 09:00", "avg_engagement": 7.9}
  ]
}
```

### 3. Content Performance Analysis

**Compares performance across:**

**Voice Types:**
- Personal vs Coach vs Professional
- Which voice resonates best with your audience

**Scenarios:**
- Game highlights, recruiting updates, partner appreciation, etc.
- Ranked by engagement rate

**Media Presence:**
- Posts with graphics vs without
- Impact of media on engagement (typically 20-50% boost)

**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "by_voice_type": {
    "personal": {"post_count": 15, "avg_performance": 6.8},
    "coach": {"post_count": 8, "avg_performance": 7.2},
    "professional": {"post_count": 5, "avg_performance": 5.1}
  },
  "by_scenario": [
    {"scenario": "game_highlights", "post_count": 10, "avg_performance": 8.1},
    {"scenario": "recruiting_update", "post_count": 8, "avg_performance": 7.5},
    {"scenario": "partner_appreciation", "post_count": 6, "avg_performance": 6.2}
  ],
  "by_media_presence": {
    "with_media": {"post_count": 18, "avg_performance": 7.8},
    "without_media": {"post_count": 10, "avg_performance": 4.9}
  }
}
```

### 4. Actionable Insights

**AI-generated recommendations:**

- **Posting Frequency**: "Only 2 posts in last 7 days. Aim for 3-5 posts per week."
- **Optimal Timing**: "Your best performing day is Tuesday. Schedule more posts on this day."
- **Content Strategy**: "'game_highlights' posts perform best (8.1% engagement). Create more of this content."
- **Media Impact**: "Posts with media perform 59% better. Always include graphics or video!"

**Priority Levels:**
- **High**: Immediate action needed
- **Medium**: Should address soon
- **Low**: Nice to have improvement
